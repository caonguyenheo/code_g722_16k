ITU-T G.729 Software Package Release 2 (November 2006)
README
~~~~~~

This folder contains the two electronic attachments to G.729 Appendix II.

The first in folder c_code is the file vad.c , which is a replacement file for the one distributed with G.729 Annex B. 
This modified vad.c implements the algorithm described in Appendix II.

The second attachment is a set of test files that were used for testing G.729 Appendix II. 
These test files are found in the folder "test_vectors". There is a dedicated readme file in that folder.
