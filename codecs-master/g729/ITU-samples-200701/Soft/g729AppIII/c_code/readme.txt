CONTENT
-------

This folder contains the three electronic attachments to G.729 Appendix III.

The first two in folder c_code are the files dtx.c and vad.c, which are replacement files 
for the ones distributed with G.729 Annex B. The modified dtx.c and vad.c
implement the solution mentioned in Appendix III.

The third attachment is a set of test files that were used for testing 
G.729 Appendix III. These test files are found in the folder 
"test_vectors". There is a dedicated readme file in that folder.
